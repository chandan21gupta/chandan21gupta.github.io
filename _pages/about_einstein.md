I am currently a Research Assistant in Multiphysics & Multiscale Mechanics (M3RG) at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, under Dr. Anoop Krishnan. Here, I am currently exploring autonomy LLM Agents in Scientific Workflows, and trying to isolate its failure modes. 

In general, my research interests lie in AI for Science (Using AI to advance Natural Sciences); and Science for AI (Using first principles from Scientific Domains to improve current AI models).

Outside academics, I like to read books. I maintain a list of favourites books I read every (you can find them under the books section). My goodreads profile can be found [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188687493-chandan-gupta).
